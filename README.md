# GLM-hackathon
Hackathon on Generalised Linear Model implementation for summer interns

## Phase 1: warm-up

Tentatively the week of June 6

* getting familiar with Python programming
* reading the [lecture notes](https://github.com/huangyh09/foundation-data-science/tree/main/lectures) 
  of foundation of data science, including the scripts
* finishing the [two assignments](https://github.com/huangyh09/foundation-data-science/tree/main/assignments)

## Phase 2: practice

Tentatively the week of June 13

* implementing a logistic regression from scratch
* extend to binomial regression
* compare to [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression)
* compare to [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/glm.html)

## Phase 3: challenge

Tentatively the week of June 20 onwards (optional)

* reimplement logistic regression with existing optimisers, e.g., 
  [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)
* implement beta-binomial regression with optimiser
* compare to [aod R package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/aod/versions/1.3.1/topics/betabin)
